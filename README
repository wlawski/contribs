contribs
--------

contribs is a script that analyzes files using Git repository to prepare
contribution statistics.

Requirements
------------

On *nix system this script should just work, if Git is installed.

To use it on Windows, you should run it in Git Bash. It is enough to run
contribs 'out-of-the-box' but script will be VERY slow. It is recommended to
install paste application in your system. You can download it via MinGW. MinGW
installer is located here:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/

After successful installation of this tool, run it and install msys-bash (bin)
from: All Packages > MSYS (if graphical interface has been installed for
MinGW). Then you can just copy paste.exe, msys-intl-8.dll and msys-iconv-2.dll
files from MSYS binaries directory to the same directory where you have
installed Git Bash executable.
